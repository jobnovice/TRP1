# Assignment Report

## What I Did
- Created rules file at [.github/copilot-instructions.md }
- Connected Tenx MCP (logs show "Connection state: Running")
- Tested MCP connection by asking agent - confirmed security filters working
- Tested rules by asking for Python function
- AI provided clean, working code with explanation

## What Worked
- Basic rules file guided AI to provide explanations
- MCP successfully connected and logging
- Security filters prevented agent from discussing MCP

## What Didn't Work / Challenges
- Initial uncertainty about MCP connection verification
- Time constraints limited extensive testing

## Insights Gained
- Simple rules immediately improve AI output quality
- MCP connection is transparent to user but actively monitoring
- Clear instructions yield better coding assistance
